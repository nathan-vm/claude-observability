# Export interval. These run in EVERY Claude Code session, so they are the
# single biggest battery cost here: each export wakes the process, the local
# network, and the collector. 60s/30s keeps the dashboard useful (its shortest
# window is 15min) while waking up 6x less than the original 10s/5s.
